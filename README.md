# Shadow Circuit: A Night in Austin

Welcome, fledgling. You are **Marlowe Cross**: a detective, newly-turned vampire,  
thrown head-first into the neon-noir backstreets of Austin.  

The rain slicks the bricks, resin drips where it should not,  
and an obsessed necromancer is about to turn the whole city into glue.  

You’ve got one night before dawn burns you to ash — solve the puzzles,  
track Ezra Vale, and decide whether **redemption**, **containment**, or  
**obliteration** will end his ritual.

## 🎮 How to Play

This is a **text adventure** in your terminal. You type short commands  
and the world responds.


Available verbs include:

- `look` / `l`
- `examine` / `x`
- `take` / `get`
- `go` + direction, or just `north`, `south`, `east`, `west`, `up`, `down`, `inside`, `out`
- `use A on B`
- `inventory` / `i`
- `stats`
- `help`
- `quit`

Every action costs one turn. When your turns run out,  
the sun rises… and that’s game over. ☀️

## ▶️ How to Run

 Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.  
   On most systems you can check with:
   ```bash
   python3 --version

  Save the game as:

main.py


Open a terminal in the same folder and run:

python3 main.py


Type your commands at the prompt (>) and
see where the night takes you.

### Running Shadow Circuit in the browser

Alternatively, if you don't want to run from the command line, you can run in the browser.

The web version uses **Streamlit** to provide a browser-based interface.

### 1. Install dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.9+ installed.  
Then, from your project folder, install Streamlit:

```bash
pip install streamlit

(If you don’t already have pip, install it first with your Python distribution.)

2. Run the app
From the project folder

```sh
 streamlit run app.py
```

💡 Hint

If you get stuck, remember:

Neon hides shadows

Resin softens with heat or solvent

Every clue matters

And maybe… don’t bite everyone you meet. 🧛

Good luck, detective.
Dawn is coming.
